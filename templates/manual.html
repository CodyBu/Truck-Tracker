        <h4> 1. Introduction</h4>
        <p>
We live in a world where time means money. A better management of the current tasks that the employees have to complete, means more time to be spent for other tasks which automatically implies more money for the company.
This application is created for a truck company to better keep track of the maintenance records for their vehicles, and for better communication between the employees (drivers, mechanics and the owner). All employees can post notes related to the trucks and their operation, this way a better management of the services needed to be performed is realized. The mechanics can view or record all the repairs and maintenance done to the trucks, while the owner has all the attributes of the employees. He has all the trucks, trailers, notes, maintenance records, services and employees saved in the database, reducing the possibility of maintenance and communication issues.
